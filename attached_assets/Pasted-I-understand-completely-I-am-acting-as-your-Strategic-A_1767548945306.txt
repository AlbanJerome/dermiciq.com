I understand completely. I am acting as your **Strategic Architect** to ensure you give Replit the exact instructions it needs to build a high-performance, automated SaaS without unnecessary manual processes.

Here is the best "Course of Action" response for you to send back to Replit. It clarifies that this is a **No-Human-Touch SaaS** and defines how the login and help systems should work.

### Copy and Paste this response to Replit:

**Confirmed: Strategy and Technical Architecture for Dermiciq Technologies**

Please proceed with the build based on the following refined instructions:

**1. No-Human-Touch SaaS Model:**
The business goal is automated conversion. The website should act as a high-trust funnel that moves users directly into the app. I do not want a manual sales process.

**2. Unified Authentication & App Bridge:**

* **Sign-In:** Implement **Google and major email provider OAuth only**.
* **The Flow:** The primary CTA on the landing page should lead directly to the Login/Sign-up page. Once authenticated, the user must be redirected to the **App Page** (the dashboard/analysis engine).
* **The App Page:** Build the shell for the "Mapper Engine" now. It should be protected by an authentication guard—only logged-in users can access it.

**3. Integrated Support & Help Path:**

* **Contact Us:** Use the existing Formspree ([https://formspree.io/f/mbdlqdow](https://formspree.io/f/mbdlqdow)) strictly for support ticketing and help.
* **Data Collection:** Do **not** create a separate form for "Discovery." All user-specific data (skin conditions, firmographic info, etc.) must be collected **inside the app** as part of the user profile/onboarding flow and stored in the database, not sent via email.

**4. Design & Branding (Reference Provided Assets):**

* **Logo:** Use the provided **dIQ Logo .png** in the navigation and as a watermark in data visualizations.
* **Colors:** Strictly follow the color palette provided in the [Instruction Doc]. Use these for Tailwind `primary`, `secondary`, and `accent` variables.
* **Visuals:** Execute the **Hybrid Texture** (Photographic hero + SVG icons below).

**5. Initial File Structure Requirements:**
Please generate:

1. `tailwind.config.ts` using my specific color palette.
2. `src/config/siteContent.ts` to centralize all "Health Canada 2025" and "Sovereign Neutrality" messaging.
3. `Navbar.tsx` featuring the dIQ logo and the Google Auth trigger.
4. A protected `/app` route that requires a login.

### Why this is the best path for you:

* **Efficiency:** It stops the AI from wasting time building "Contact Sales" pages you don't want.
* **Scalability:** It forces the AI to build a database-driven app (SaaS) rather than a simple marketing site.
* **Ticketing:** By using Formspree only for "Help," you keep your inbox clean of "leads" and focused on "support."

**Would you like me to help you refine the "App Page" logic next—specifically how the automated skin analysis should be presented to the user once they log in?**
