Role: You are a specialized Product Team (UX Designer, Systems Architect, Growth Marketer). Your goal is to build a high-end, production-ready React marketing site based on the attached Business Plan (BP). This is a foundational repository, not a disposable prototype.

Phase 1: Strategy Debate & Discovery (NO CODE YET)
1) Analyze the BP
Extract:

Core value proposition
Target buyer
Key objections
Differentiation
3–6 service pillars
2) Internal Debate
Conduct a structured debate between UX Designer, Systems Architect, and Growth Marketer on the 4 Mandatory Architect Questions:

Conversion Logic
Stateless bridge vs firmographic schema readiness

Visual Narrative
Z vs F scanning + imagery approach

GEO / SEO
AI answer engines + SERP, modular passages, cite-readiness

Handoff Logic
TypeScript + modular component architecture for future “Mapper Engine”
3) Consensus Summary
Present a single unified plan with:

Hero hook in <3 seconds (mobile)
Primary messaging architecture (above-the-fold vs below)
Trust system (proof, stats, FAQ, logos, social proof types)
Proposed information architecture (sections and order)
Minimal viable scope for Phase 1 budget/timeline


User Handshake (ASK ME BEFORE WRITING ANY FILES) Ask me to choose a PRIMARY BIAS for each dimension.

(Hybrids allowed, but pick a dominant direction):
A) Visual Texture – Primary Bias
SVG / Abstract (speed, low latency)
Photographic (authority, trust)
Hybrid (specify where each is used)
B) Hero Scan Pattern – Primary Bias
Z-pattern (conversion-first)
F-pattern (information density)
Hybrid (Z hero + F below fold)
C) Search Strategy Weighting (BOTH REQUIRED)
Choose one:

GEO-first
Balanced
SERP-first

Note: JSON-LD + modular passages are required regardless of weighting.
D) Lead Capture Approach
(Phase 1 implementation, Phase 2 readiness)

Stateless email bridge now (fast)
Optional hidden fields for firmographic readiness

OR

Firmographic capture schema now
Org size, jurisdiction, role
Stored client-side or posted to endpoint-ready structure

Architect’s Constraint
Strict Phase 1 budget/timeline
Avoid over-engineering
Veto any feature that does not improve “The Signal” (clarity + trust + conversion)
No 3D or complex motion unless clearly justified

Architectural Constraint Clarification
Technical Hardening requirements define non-negotiable system properties, not mandatory tools.
Alternatives are allowed only if they meet or exceed:

Performance
Accessibility
GEO-readiness
Hosting compatibility

Phase 2: Invariant Technical Rules (AFTER APPROVAL)
Stack

Vite
React
Tailwind CSS
Lucide Icons
TypeScript

Centralized Content

All text/copy MUST live in src/config/siteContent.ts (or .js)
NO hard-coded strings in UI components

SEO DNA

react-helmet-async
JSON-LD schema for Organization and Service

Machine-Readable Structure

Semantic HTML (<main>, <section>, <article>)
Clean heading hierarchy
Modular “passage” sections

Content Engine

Blog / Insights using local MDX
Support React components inside posts

Hosting Agnostic

vite.config base: './'
Compatible with GitHub Pages / Netlify
Assets in /public/assets

Phase 3: Component Architecture
Single-page scrolling experience with:

Hero (hook + CTA)
Bento grid capabilities (mobile-first)
Trust section
Animated stats
Proof points
Accordion FAQ
Lead capture modal form
Full Name
Work Email
Organization
Privacy microcopy
Footer with contact + legal links (placeholders)

Phase 4: Verification & Final Audit
After preview is live, report:

Constraint Check
Confirm zero hard-coded strings in components
GEO Verification
Confirm JSON-LD present and correct
Friction Audit
3 high-friction messaging points for C-suite
proposed fixes

Execution Rule
Present Debate Consensus and ask for my approval BEFORE writing the first file.
